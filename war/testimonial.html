						<br><br><h5 class="for">Scavenging started from South Africa- His initiative

								</h5>
								<p>Gandhi learnt scavenging in South Africa. His friends there lovingly called him thegreat scavenger. 
								Mahatma Gandhi said, “Everyone must be his own scavenger.” (The mind of Mahatma Gandhi)
                            Aftera three-year stay in South Africa, he returned to India to fetch his wife andsons.
                            Plague had broken out in the Bombay Presidency at that time. 
                          There was achance of it spreading to Rajkot. Gandhi immediately offered his service for improving the sanitation of Rajkot. 
                          He inspected every home and stressed theneed of keeping the latrines clean. The dark, filthy, stinking pits infested with vermin horrified him.
                         In some houses belonging to the upper class, gutterswere used as a privy and the stench was unbearable. The residents were apathetic. 
                             Poor untouchables lived in cleaner homes and responded to Gandhi'spleadings. Gandhi suggested the use of two separate buckets for urine andnight-soil and that improved the sanitation.

						<br><br><h5 class="for">Need for Cleanliness Everywhere-His philosphy

								</h5>
								<p>After twenty years stay inthat alien land, Gandhi, at 46, finally returned to India with his group.During his visit to Kumbh Mela at Hardwar that year, he with his Phoenix boysserved as bhangis at the mela. 
The same year Gandhi visitedthe Servants of India Society's quarters at Poona. The members of the smallcolony saw him cleaning the latrines one morning. They did not like it. ButGandhi believed that work of this kind qualified one for Swaraj. 
More than once he toured allover India. Wherever and whenever he went, he found unsanitary conditions insome form or other and said that though few could afford shoes, it wasunthinkable to walk barefoot in India. Even in a city like Bombay, peoplewalked about the streets under the fear of being spat upon by the occupants of buildingsaround. The filth and stench of public urinal and latrines on railway stations andin dharmashalas were awful. Gandhi deplored the passengers' habit ofdirtying the railway compartments. 
The roads used by the poorvillagers and their bullocks were always ill-kept. He saw people taking a dipin a sacred pond without caring to know how dirty that bathing place or thewater was. They themselves dirtied the river-banks. It hurt him to see the marblefloor of Kashi Vishwanath Temple set with silver coins collecting dirt. 
In talking withmunicipalities, Gandhi often said; “I congratulate you on your spacious roads,your splendid lighting and your beautiful parks. But a municipality does not deserve to exist which does not possess model water-closets and where streetsand lanes are not kept clean all the hours of the day and night. Have you everthought of the conditions in which the sweepers live?"

						<br><br><h5 class="for">Finally how we thought about it..

								</h5>
								<p>Mahatma Gandhi always dreamt of a clean India , according to him keeping the society clean was much more important than independence.. And in order to fulfill this unfulfilled dream of the father of our nation , we thought of creating something that would change the mindset of the people,
								that would make them realize about their misplaced social values so that they should take initiative for the betterment of the society.
								 Society should be reformed , the culprits should be taught the social values , Because what we are, truly reflects in the society.
								 As In order to see the change we have to be the change, thus was House Of Change initiated.
